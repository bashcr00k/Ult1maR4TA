Hey everyone ! 

- I decided to share this project where i will be starting from a very simple windows c reverse shell backdoor and make it the ultimate rat that has all the different functions you'll ever need !
- I will try to focus on this project only and update the tool weekly with new features.
- The main goal of this project is to learn more about cybersecurity and its different topics where we will be expirementing with networking, windows api, firewall evasion, privilege escalation, persistance techniques, post exploitation techniques, encryption and more !!
- Why c ? because c gives us direct interaction with system calls as well as the possibility of embedding assembly code which we will need later on. 
- I am always open for new ideas and improvements !

IMPORTANT : 

Check the realeases for older versions!!!
I will only upload a new release after a big update !!!
USAGE : 


first compile both the c2 and the reverse shell >>    

`gcc -o Ult1maR4TA.exe Ult1maR4TA.c -lws2_32`

`gcc -o c2.exe C2.c -lws2_32 `

To start the C2 :

`./C2 [IP ADDR] [PORT]`

Of course then the reverse shell has to be started
